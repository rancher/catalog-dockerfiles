# Dockerfiles for Rancher Catalog Items.
----
## Purpose 

These are the Dockerfiles for the containers that we use for Rancher entries in the community catalog. Also, you will find compose files that are here for development purposes. 

## Layout
Each App has its own folder. There is a containers directory where the various containers for the apps are kept. We try to version the directories to the version of the container.
